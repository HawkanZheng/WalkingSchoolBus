When testing, if a route contains too many waypoints the server will return an error.
To solve this use simpler paths with striaght lines rather than cureves.

To add a new route, long press on the maps activity, and select a start and an end location.
Then tap on the start location to view the path, and finally press the "Save new group" button, to confirm the creation of the group.
Once done, select the refresh button in order to view your group on the map.

To join a pre-existing group, select a marker to view the path, then select the "Join group" button.

To add another user to a group, select a marker, and then tap the "Add user to group button"
